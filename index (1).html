  <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
  <p>Investment landscapes have evolved, extending beyond
traditional listed securities to include unlisted sharesâ€”a
distinctive arena with unique dynamics and challenges. This
research embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the
unlisted market, unravelling its performance and growth
prospects year-to-year.
In contrast to the transparency of listed shares, unlisted
securities operate in a closed environment, requiring an indepth analysis of market behaviour, sectoral variations, and the
impact of public participation. With the primary goal of
understanding the nuances of this unregulated market, the study
examines stock price variations, public versus promoter
shareholding, and the comparative earnings of unlisted shares
against their listed counterparts.
As the global investment landscape evolves, the unlisted
market garners attention for its potential and challenges. By
delving into this uncharted territory, the research aims to
provide valuable insights for investors, policymakers, and
financial analysts, offering a nuanced perspective on growth
prospects and contributions to the broader investment
ecosystem. </p>
  <h2>DATA SOURCES</h2>
  <p> 1. Primary Data
Primary data refers to information collected first-hand by the
researcher through methods such as interviews, questionnaires,
and observations. In this study, primary data was gathered
through interviews to select the most traded shares.
2. Secondary Data
Secondary data includes information obtained from already
published sources such as government agencies, libraries, and
company records. It may also involve analyzing data collected
first-hand by others. For this research, secondary data was
sourced from annual reports, company websites, and official
records.
3. Data Collection Methods/Tools
Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheets were the primary
tools utilized for data collection and analysis.
4. Specific Data Sources
Data was primarily sourced from company records maintained
in Microsoft Excel, annual reports for the years 2022 and 2023,
and official company websites. Additionally, the Capitaline
database was consulted to verify dividend payments.

Hypothesis
The research aims to test the hypothesis that the analysis of
different sectors in the unlisted market provides growth
prospects on an annualized yield basis.</p>
  <h2>CONCLUSIONS AND OBSERVATIONS</h2>
  <p>The research highlights significant volatility and negative
annualized yields in several shares over the past year. However,
some companies have paid substantial dividends, and the
growth opportunities in these shares cannot be overlooked. The
manufacturing and insurance sectors outperformed other
sectors, while only a few stocks in the banking, financial, and
IT sectors showed strong performance.
Unlike the regulated listed market, the unregulated nature of
the unlisted market is characterized by a substantial public
shareholding, providing retail investors with an alternative
investment avenue through the over-the-counter market. The
main challenge faced by this industry is liquidity, which can
hinder investment flow into these sectors. Instances were noted
where selected shares were not traded through chosen brokers
due to a lack of demand. A significant challenge in the unlisted
market is the lack of information parity, unlike the listed market
governed by SEBI regulations and listing obligations. The
information available through selected brokers may not always
be consistent.
A major drawback of the unlisted market is that buyers often
enter during periods of euphoria rather than with a focus on
long-term growth prospects or diversification, leading to
overvaluation of shares. Therefore, it is crucial to invest at the
right price and in fundamentally strong companies for
profitable investments.</p>

A downward trend in the stock market, both listed and unlisted shares was witnessed due to regulations changes in investment strategies and individual risk tolerance in defence of the Russian-Ukraine war. Every country made primary changes in their system module which led to a substantial decline in the stock market. The investment market turned volatile and its reaction was a weaker global stock market, following the weeks of the Russian invasion.
Several supervisory changes were seen, which could have contributed to the decline in the participants in the Indian trading market. Since RBIâ€™s supervisory jurisdiction now extends to the financial system barring the Capital market institution and insurance sector, resilience in the investors was observed.
Complex tax rules seemed to burden the participants, resulting in declining participation in the Indian Market. The convoluted tax rules lead to a fall in quantity traded and deviation in the revenue of the government, and the imperative result of these changes are lesser number of interested investors in the Indian stock market.
